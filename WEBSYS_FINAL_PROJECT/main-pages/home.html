            1. Help Scout

            Sometimes, the best blog designs are also the simplest. Help Scout, makers of customer service software, uses a unique but minimalist design on its blog that we love — it limits the use of copy and visuals and embraces negative space.

            What we particularly like about this blog is its use of featured images for all posts, including a banner one at the top that highlights a recent or particularly popular entry. These icons are set in front of bright, block colors that catch the readers' eye and signal what the post is about. And it works — everything about this blog's design says "clean" and "readable."

            2. Microsoft Stories

            Full disclosure: We've totally gushed over Microsoft's "Stories" microsite before. We can't help it — what better way to revitalize an old-school brand than with a blog that boasts beautiful, interactive, and inspiring branded content? Plus, the square layout of these stories is reminiscent of the Microsoft logo, which achieves a valuable brand consistency.

            Microsoft Stories is also a prime example of how a business blog can be a major asset for an overall rebrand. In recent years, Microsoft has worked to humanize its brand, largely in response to a rivalry with Apple. The "Stories" microsite has a simple tagline — "Get an inside look at the people, places and ideas that move us." It's the softer side of Microsoft, so to speak.

            When you're trying to convey a certain brand message, your blog can be used to communicate it — both aesthetically, and content-wise.

            3. Pando

            An important aspect of a well-designed blog is a consistent color scheme and style — after all, 80% of consumers say that color boosts their recognition of a brand.

            It's interesting to see how color consistency can unify the more diversified elements of design. Pando, a blog that explores the startup cycle, incorporates bluetones in several sections of its site — the background, highlight bars, and certain areas of text. But it also uses several different fonts — all of which manage to look seamless together,when tied together by a cohesive color scheme.

            Design Milk, an online contemporary design outlet, uses a very simple layout to highlight its posts. The sidebar to the right — which remains visiblewhen a blog post is opened to read — is perfect for showcasing thumbnail images for new articles. That's an internal link strategy, which helps to encourage readers to remain on the site longer.

            The social icons at the top are a pleasant addition to the overall look and feel of the site — they're easy to spot, and make it easy to share Design Milk's content. (And to learn more about adding social buttons to your blog, check out this post.)

            5. Fubiz

            Fubiz, an art and design blog, is an example of a really sleek design that also includes some cool personalization.

            Near the top of the blog's homepage, readers can side-scroll through "highlighted" posts. Below that is the Creativity Finder, where visitors can select their chosen personas — from "Art Lover" to "Freelance" — location, and the type of content they're looking for. From there, readers can browse content specifically catered to them.

            We can't help but love the header image, too. It uses something called "blue mind" psychology, which has found that the sight of open water can naturally draw us in. By using it in a design scheme, Fubiz is able to visually attract visitors to its content.
